*  1) Use the DATA step debugger to step through one      *;
*     iteration of the DATA step. Observe the values of   *;
*     Year and ProjectedSales as they are updated.        *;
*  2) Close the debugger and run the program. Examine the *;
*     log and output data. How many rows are in the input *;
*     and output tables?                                  *;
